Welcome to my blog on computational fabrication! This is my journey learning about the intricacies of the computational design, and digital fabrication worlds.

At this point in my life, I am a senior studying computer science at the University of Colorado Boulder. I hope to expand my knowledge, and not only learns how to design through computation, but create physical pieces that are biproducts of what I have learned.
