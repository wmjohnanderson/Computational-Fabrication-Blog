This project is a fascinating journey into the realm of Computational Fabrication. In this project, I research the intricate world where nature meets human innovation. I first dive into examples from the botanical and zoological world, then take a look at sophisticated structures created by organisms all with the goal of discovering how computational principles are ever present in the world today. I then expand this exploration into man made environments in order to find computational designs throughout the world. Finally I detail a few researchers/artists of computational fabrication who I find interesting, and I'm keeping my eye on.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.


To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
