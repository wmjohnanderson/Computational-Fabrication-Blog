title: "Examples of Computational Fabrication"

This project is a fascinating journey into the realm of Computational Fabrication. In this project, I research the intricate world where nature meets human innovation. I first dive into examples from the botanical and zoological world, then take a look at sophisticated structures created by organisms all with the goal of discovering how computational principles are ever present in the world today. I then expand this exploration into man made environments in order to find computational designs throughout the world. Finally I detail a few researchers/artists of computational fabrication who I find interesting, and I'm keeping my eye on.
